# TEST PROJECT: Cost effective delivery

## Task

Dóri would like to order 10 “Bride Squad” T-shirts for her girlfriend's upcoming bachelorette party.

She decided to send her order via the qberon-tshirts.hu website and entered a coordinate as the delivery address.
qberon-tshirts.hu has 3 warehouses, and each warehouse has it’s own T-Shirt stock and unique coordinate.

Goal:

Finding the most cost effective transport route by the combination of the warehouses for  qberon-tshirts.hu.

Rule:

* In case of transport between Dóri’s delivery address and a warehouse, 100% of cost is calculated.
* In case of transport between warehouses, only 15% cost is calculated.
* Dóri must meet only with one courier.

Additional info

* There are many ways to solve the problem! Try to implement a business realistic model.
* Use PHP programming language.
* Do not use any persistent storage. Store everything you need in memory.
* You can use any third-party library.
* Do not use any third-party services.
* Do not implement the user interface.
* Do not write a pseudo code. Write a code that you would commit/push to a repository
* and which solves the given problem.
* Create a readme for your project.
* Share your solution with us as a private git repository.

Bonus – Not mandatory

* Including Unit tests is a plus.
* Clean Code (by Robert. C. Martin) makes us happy.
